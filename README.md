# Spectrophotometric-bayesian-distances

Precise spectroscopic distance estimator for main sequence stars with uncertainties of ∼6 per cent for single stars. It explicitly accounts for the individual parallax uncertainties in the model building and fully incorporates the fraction of near-equal binaries of main sequence stars. This model is presented in Coronado et al. 2018: "Unbiased TGAS× LAMOST distances and the role of binarity", MNRAS, 481, 2970
